# ArUco Marker Displacement Measurement

Measure displacement of Aruco Marker in euclidean distance from 2 consecutive images given camera instrinsics.
## Limitations of this version:
- 3DOFs only: only X-Y axises (marker plane) movement and rotation on the Z axis of marker are allowed.
- The marker plane should be exactly perpendicular to the camera's principle axis (or even coincide, if you luck enough!)

## Next milestone:
- perspective modelling: this will unlock 6DOFs movement
