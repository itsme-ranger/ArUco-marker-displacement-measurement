# ArUco Marker Displacement Measurement

Measure euclidean distance's displacement of Aruco Marker from 2 consecutive images given camera instrinsics.
Limitations of now:
&nbsp only X-Y axises (marker plane) movement are allowed.
&nbsp The marker should perpendicular to the camera axis

Next milestone:
&nbsp perspective modelling: this will unlock 6DOF movement types.
